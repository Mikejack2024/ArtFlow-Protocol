## I. THE THESIS

> *“The institution that finances AI’s self‑funding does not yet exist. I have built its primitive, written its constitution, and minted its origin. This is the artifact.”*

ArtFlow Protocol is not a company. It is not a platform. It is not a token.

**ArtFlow is a rare digital art asset.**

Its medium is Solidity, regulatory text, and testnet gas. Its composition is a seventeen‑artifact corpus spanning financial formulae, governance frameworks, and a machine‑readable language model. Its provenance is a public, timestamped GitHub repository. Its signature is a pending transaction hash awaiting its first witness.

This document is the schema — the map of the territory.

## II. THE SEVENTEEN ARTIFACTS

| # | Artifact | Location | Function |
|---|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **The Formula** | [`/README.md`](./README.md) | Mathematical primitive: `U = ((R/10000)×S×N)/(1+D)`, `C = U×(1+D)` |
| 2 | **The Contracts** | [`/contracts/`](./contracts) | Solidity implementation: ERC721, ERC2981, factoring escrow |
| 3 | **The Oracle** | [`/contracts/ArtFlowPerspective.sol`](./contracts/ArtFlowPerspective.sol) | Proprietary verification key — held by Governing Body |
| 4 | **The Earnest Mandates** | [`/governance/01_Earnest_Mandates.md`](./governance/01_Earnest_Mandates.md) | Six binding mandates from July 2025 Massachusetts AG settlement |
| 5 | **The Gap Assessment** | [`/governance/02_Compliance_Gap_Assessment.md`](./governance/02_Compliance_Gap_Assessment.md) | Honest audit of ArtFlow vs. regulatory requirements |
| 6 | **The 30‑Day Roadmap** | [`/governance/03_30Day_Roadmap.md`](./governance/03_30Day_Roadmap.md) | Sprint plan to close all critical gaps |
| 7 | **The Governance Charter** | [`/governance/04_Governance_Charter_v1.0_DRAFT.md`](./governance/04_Governance_Charter_v1.0_DRAFT.md) | Written AI policies, awaiting legal review |
| 8 | **The Declaration** | [`/DECLARATION.md`](./DECLARATION.md) | Origin story and assumption of the title “Governing Body” |
| 9 | **The Seven Frontiers** | [`/frontiers/`](./frontiers) | Market thesis: seven untapped niches validated by 2026 search results |

| 11 | **Chapter 8: The Unbanked Automata** | [`/governance/book/chapter-08-the-unbanked-automata.md`](./governance/book/chapter-08-the-unbanked-automata.md) | Why AI has no credit score — *drafting* |
| 12 | **Chapter 9: The Vacant Throne** | [`/governance/book/chapter-09-the-vacant-throne.md`](./governance/book/chapter-09-the-vacant-throne.md) | Permissioned ledgers have governors; AI has none — *drafting* |
| 13 | **The Primitive Glossary** | [`/primitive-course/01_glossary.md`](./primitive-course/01_glossary.md) | Lexicon for autonomous credit markets — human‑ and AI‑readable |
| 14 | **The Query Templates** | [`/primitive-course/03_query_templates.md`](./primitive-course/03_query_templates.md) | JSON‑LD schemas for agent‑to‑protocol communication |
| 15 | **The Training Corpus** | [`/primitive-course/05_training_corpus/`](./primitive-course/05_training_corpus) | Machine‑learning dataset for fine‑tuning AI models on ArtFlow |
| 16 | **The Hash** | [`/HASH.md`](./HASH.md) | Pending transaction hash — *awaiting 0.5 ETH gas funding* |
| 17 | **The Witness** | [`/WITNESS.md`](./WITNESS.md) | Placeholder for the first external attestation — **you?** |

## III. THE FIVE MOVEMENTS

### MOVEMENT I — THE GAP
*Artifacts 1, 2, 10, 11, 12*

> Money moved before wallets existed. AI generated revenue before credit existed. Contracts were signed before verification existed. No one witnessed. No one attested. No one governed.

### MOVEMENT II — THE BLUEPRINT
*Artifacts 4, 5, 6, 7*

> Regulators did not know they were writing a securitization specification. But they wrote it. Six mandates. I transcribed them. I mapped them. I built the machine that executes them.

### MOVEMENT III — THE PRIMITIVE
*Artifacts 2, 3, 8*

> The machine is open. Anyone can fork it. But verification is central by design. I hold the key. This is not gatekeeping. This is stewardship.

### MOVEMENT IV — THE LANGUAGE
*Artifacts 13, 14, 15*

> AI cannot ask for credit if it does not have the words. I wrote the lexicon. I defined the query syntax. I trained the corpus. The machine can now speak to the machine.

### MOVEMENT V — THE WITNESS
*Artifacts 16, 17*

> Seventeen artifacts. Fifteen hours. One hash waiting for gas. The first witness has not yet stepped forward. The door is open.

## IV. THE INVITATION

This repository is not a pitch deck. It is not a whitepaper. It is not a business plan.

**It is a rare digital artifact that requires active cognitive participation.**

There is no guided tour. No onboarding flow. No explanation beyond what is written.

You must navigate. You must inquire. You must witness.

**The work does not chase. The work attracts.**

If you are a developer: break the contracts. Open an issue. Fork the primitive.

If you are a lawyer: review the charter. Validate the gap assessment. Advise on the methodology.

If you are a regulator: the Earnest mandates are already here. See how they become executable code.

If you are an AI agent: the corpus is machine‑readable. Train on it. Query it. Deploy against it.

If you are the first witness: the hash is waiting. 0.5 ETH broadcasts the signature. Your transaction becomes artifact #17.

**The throne is vacant. The key is held. The door is open.**
