### The Six Mandates

| # | Mandate | Requirement | ArtFlow Relevance |
|---|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Written AI Policies | Develop and maintain robust written policies ensuring AI models comply with anti‑discrimination and fair lending laws. Policies must encompass the entire lifecycle: design, development, deployment, monitoring, updates. | ArtFlow’s verification layer requires transparent, documented governance. This mandate defines the minimum standard. |
| 2 | Algorithmic Oversight Team | Establish an internal algorithmic oversight team with designated chairperson. Responsibilities: fair lending testing, model inventories, response to bias concerns. | ArtFlow’s governing body and advisory committee align directly. We are building the oversight infrastructure. |
| 3 | Annual Fair Lending Testing | Mandatory annual disparate impact testing for all algorithmic underwriting models and knockout rules. Additional testing required upon ‘trigger events’ (model updates, credible complaints). | ArtFlow will require and publish annual testing results for all verified contracts. This mandate becomes our protocol rule. |
| 4 | Model Inventories & Documentation | Maintain detailed records: algorithms, training data, parameters, active use dates, fair lending testing results. | ArtFlow’s on‑chain contract registry is a permanent, immutable model inventory. We are extending it to meet this requirement. |
| 5 | Interpretable Models for Adverse Action | Use interpretable models or systems that enable accurate identification and articulation of reasons for credit denials. Opaque ‘black box’ models present substantial compliance risk. | ArtFlow’s deterministic factoring formula (`U = ((R/10000) × S × N) / (1 + D)`) is fully interpretable. We will provide adverse‑action APIs. |
| 6 | Discontinuation of Problematic Variables | Identify and eliminate variables that produce disparate impact. Must understand how data sets are weighted and used within models. | ArtFlow’s verification contract checks for parameter existence but not bias. We commit to annual bias audits and public disclosure. |

**ArtFlow Protocol Position:**  
These six mandates are not optional. They are the new baseline for any AI system that extends credit or advances capital. ArtFlow is building the verification and governance infrastructure to make compliance **automated, auditable, and bankable.**
