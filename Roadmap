## Deliverables by Mandate

| Mandate | Deliverable | Owner | Due | Success Metric | Public Evidence |
|---------|------------|-------|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| **1** | **ArtFlow Governance Charter v1.0** – Written AI policies covering model lifecycle, compliance criteria, appeals, and amendment process. | Governing Body | Day 7 | Document published in `/governance`; reviewed by legal counsel. | `04_Governance_Charter_v1.0.md` |
| **2** | **Interim Algorithmic Oversight Committee** – Chair (Governing Body), Legal Advisor, Technical Advisor. Committee charter and meeting cadence defined. | Governing Body + Advisors | Day 10 | Org chart with bios; committee charter published. | `/governance/05_Committee_Charter.md` |
| **3** | **Fair Lending Testing Protocol v1.0** – Methodology for disparate impact analysis, including protected classes, statistical tests, and trigger events. Simulated audit report on testnet data. | Governing Body + Advisor | Day 21 | Public Jupyter notebook / Python script; published report with results (even if null). | `governance/audits/2026-03_simulated_audit.md` |
| **4** | **On‑chain ArtFlow Registry Contract** – Immutable smart contract that records every verified ArtFlow deployment. Includes deployer address, verification hash, timestamp, and active status. Front‑end viewer (Etherscan / custom). | Governing Body | Day 14 | Contract deployed on Sepolia/Base; source code verified; GitHub link. | `contracts/ArtFlowRegistry.sol` |
| **5** | **Adverse Action API** – Given a rejection (factor declined to advance), return the specific parameter(s) that caused denial, with plain‑English explanation. Example: *“Your expected annual sales volume (N=2) is below our minimum threshold of 3.”* | Governing Body | Day 21 | API endpoint (testnet) + example denial notice template. | `api/README.md` |
| **6** | **Initial Bias Audit** – Simulated dataset of 1,000+ testnet factoring requests. Analysis of approval rates and advance amounts across proxy demographics. Identification of any variables requiring further investigation. | Governing Body | Day 30 | Published audit report; open‑source analysis code. | `governance/audits/2026-03_bias_audit.md` |

## Dependencies

- **Legal review** for Governance Charter and testing methodology.  
- **Technical advisor** for bias audit statistical rigor.  
- **Sepolia ETH faucet** for registry deployment (0.01 ETH estimated).

## Post‑30 Day

All deliverables become **permanent, versioned artifacts** in the ArtFlow Protocol repository.  
The protocol will then be ready for:

- Public verification of third‑party deployments
- Engagement with institutional counterparties
- Formal regulatory inquiry response

**We are not waiting for permission. We are building the evidence.**
